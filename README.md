## Overview

In this paper, the MoMA's public GitHub data on their exhibits was used to determine how diverse the artists and decision-making staff at the MoMA are in terms of gender and nationality. This was done by comparing the percentage of female artists whose works were displayed in MoMA exhibits over time. The same was also done for female directors and department heads of the MoMA. In both cases, a positive relationship between percentage of women and time in years was found, indicating that representation of women in the MoMA has improved slightly over time.
